I am a 2nd year math-cs student at UCSD.

My current projects:

- Rust-md:

  A desktop markdown editor with a live reload fucntion, made on rust. 
  
- planner.xyi (in collab w/[Ataha322](https://github.com/ataha322)): 

  A simple broweser-based productivity tool based on a simple checklist.
  
  
I am also interested in making my own cyberdecks so hmu for any advice :)
